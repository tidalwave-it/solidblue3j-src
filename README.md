Contributing
------------

Pull requests are accepted via [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/tidalwave/solidblue3j-src) or [GitHub](https://github.com/tidalwave-it/solidblue3j-src). There are some guidelines which will make 
applying pull requests easier:

* No tabs: please use spaces for indentation.
* Respect the code style.
* Create minimal diffs â€” disable 'on save' actions like 'reformat source code' or 'organize imports' (unless you use the IDEA specific configuration for 
  this project).
* Provide [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/) tests for your changes and make sure your changes don't break any existing tests by running
```mvn clean test```. You can check whether there are currently broken tests at the [Continuous Integration](http://services.tidalwave.it/ci/view/SolidBlue3) page.

If you plan to contribute on a regular basis, please consider filing a contributor license agreement. Contact us for more information.
