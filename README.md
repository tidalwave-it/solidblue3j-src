================================

A tool for data backup and consistency.

Architecture and technologies:

+ the classic three-tier architecture is used: Model, DAO, Presentation;
+ [Spring 6 / Spring Boot 3](https://spring.io/) is the reference framework;
+ [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) is the underlying database;
+ [Spring Data JPA](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/) with [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) is used as ORM;
+ JPA entities are separated objects;
+ `Finder` and DCI roles from [TheseFoolishThings](http://tidalwave.it/projects/thesefoolishthings) are used;
+ [SLF4J](https://slf4j.org) and [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch) are used for logging;
+ [TestNG](https://testng.org) and [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) are used for testing;
+ [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org) is used for cleaner code.

SolidBlue III requires and is tested with JDKs in this range: [17, 18).
It is released under the [Apache Licence v2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).

Contributing
------------

Pull requests are accepted via [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/tidalwave/solidblue3j-src) or [GitHub](https://github.com/tidalwave-it/solidblue3j-src). There are some guidelines which will make 
applying pull requests easier:

* No tabs: please use spaces for indentation.
* Respect the code style.
* Create minimal diffs â€” disable 'on save' actions like 'reformat source code' or 'organize imports' (unless you use the IDEA specific configuration for 
  this project).
* Provide [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/) tests for your changes and make sure your changes don't break any existing tests by running
```mvn clean test```. You can check whether there are currently broken tests at the [Continuous Integration](http://services.tidalwave.it/ci/view/SolidBlue3) page.

If you plan to contribute on a regular basis, please consider filing a contributor license agreement. Contact us for more information.
